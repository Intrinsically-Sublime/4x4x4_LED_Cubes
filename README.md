Versions:

* 4x4x4_ledcube - The same as CHR's but with added effects and routines and set up for Atmega32 using 8mhz internal clock

* Micro_cube - The same code as above except for an Arduino Pro Mini 168 with outputs remapped (can be used with 328)

Added custom effects:

* custom_rain - Voxels fall and splash on bottom layer

* fireworks - Voxels fly from bottom to top and explode spherically

* custom_flyplane - Send a plane back and forth multiple times

* custom_loadbar - Allows you to leave it lit at a specified layers

* custom_random_2 - Accelerates and then decelerates

Added custom routine:
